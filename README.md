# automotive-SAR
This is a MATLAB program simulate moving target imaging by SAR in a squint looking geometry. signalGen.m generates the radar phase history data for the defined MIMO automotive SAR system and Field of View in main.m. BP is developed based on time-domain back projection to transfer the radar phase history data onto the image plane and generate the SAR image.
